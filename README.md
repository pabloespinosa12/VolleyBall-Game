# VolleyBall-Game
I am developing a VolleyBall Game Scene based in Unity and C#

This is only the first version of the game. It involves the main 3 moves of the sport: reception, colocation and smash. The goal of the scene is to show how the NPC´S 
(non-controlled players) are able to predict where they and the ball are going to be according to basic fisic´s ecuacions (mrua and mru).
